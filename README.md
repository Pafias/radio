Do you hate to have to keep switching websites when you want to listen to a different radio stream?

Well I hate it, so I made a website where I can just click on a radio stream to switch to it.

Feel free to use the code and put your own favourite radio streams there or whatever you want to do.

Or if you're okay with the radio selection I have, you can just use my website
